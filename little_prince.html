    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once
    more. <span class = "underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I
    was carrying a very fragiletreasure.</span> <span class = "highlighter"> It seemed to me,
    even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </span> In the
    moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled
    in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class = "red"> "What I see here is nothing but
    a shell. What is most important is invisible..." </span> As his lips opened slightly with
    the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class = "red"> "What
    moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty
    to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of
    a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <span class = "underline">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame
    that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span>
